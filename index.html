<hr />
<h3>1. GANGS OF WASSEYPUR(2012)</h3>
<img src="./e719b8146593961.Y3JvcCwxMDgwLDg0NCwwLDE0MQ.jpg" />
<p>Actually you guys must not get suprised if you find this gem at the top.Every inch of this movie was just perfect
  .the story was based on real incidents that took place in Wasseypur and Dhanbad region.Most of the slangs used in this movie are used by the youths even today.I think the main reason
 behind the success of this movie was casting,I mean it was just amazing to see all of the gems of bollywood in
  a single frame be it Manoj Bajpayee as "Sardar Khan" or Nawazuddinn Siddique as "Faizal Khan" or Pankaj Tripathi
  as "Sultan" or Rajkumar Rao as "Shamsad Alam",Richa Chadda as "Nagma Khatun" and Huma Qureshi as "Mohsina" and....
  My man Piyush Mishra just nailed it as "Chacha" and Tigmanshu Dhulia as "Ramadhir Singh".<br />The music in that movie was also 
  Amazing,Every song was a treat to our ears.especially <em>Jia tu,Womaniya,Hunter,kehke lunga.</em> <br />Anurag Kashyap did really excellent job , so It is my most favourite
   movie of all time.

<h3>2. 777-CHARLIE(2022)</h3>
<img src="./777 charlie.avif" width="40%" />
<p>This Kannada movie is very close to my heart. It shows the bond of love between A lonely man(who has no one in this world
  and he has no interest left in his life) and a heirless female labrador dog(who was soon going to get diagnosed with cancer).<br />this movie 
  depicts how much extent a man 
  can go to fullfill the dream of his beloved pet.this movie also throw light on the ill practice of excessive
 overbreeding done by breeders for money.<br /> Rakshit Shetty was truly amazing with his acting,and the cute <em>lab</em>
 was the real star of the movie,she was very well trained.Hence,this movie deserve a place in this list.....</p>
<hr />
<h3>3.RATSASAN(2018)</h3>
<img src="./ratsasan.jpg" width="23%" />
<p>Coming to third place we have this amazing thriller and suspense making<em>RATSASAN</em>.This movie is truly horibble and heart wobbling 
 and literally speaking not for kids and those who are weak-hearted. The acting done by the actors was upto mark.
  The action and sound effects in this movie was also very good.<br />the story is about a sub inspector(who wanted 
  to be a story writer).But soon there are several cases of school teenage girls murder are reported in his area.And,one day
 his Didi's daughter became victim of these incidents which shattered him,And the climax was truly thrilling.I literally 
 got afraid of a specially-abled man named "Christopher".Hence you must surely give it a try.....</p>
<hr />
<h3>4.KAITHI (whole LCU universe) (2019-present)</h3>
<img src="./kaithi.jpg_large" width="25%" />
<p>Kaithi-Vikram-Leo these are the gem movies of South Indian Cinema,these are one of the best Action Movies(made in India).
  The director of these movies(whole LCU) is <em>LOKESH KANAGARAJ</em>,And LCU is <em>LOKESH CINEMATIC UNIVERSE</em>.<br />
  Firstly starting from Kaithi,now in starting the movie was slow but it got it's pace very firmly and talking about
  Action,it was in every corner of the movie.The Story is about a man who was in jail for years and now he was going to
  meet his daughter who was living in an orphanage as her father was in jail and her mother died after her birth. so, the Story was 
  also very good.<br />Now coming to <em>Vikram</em>,this was one level above <em>KAITHI</em> in terms of story,thrill,action etc.
  The actors like Kamal Haasan,Vijay Sethupathi,Fahaad Faasil did really a brilliant job.Here the story is about a drug racket
  which is run by a man <em>Rolex</em> wo was not revealed till last and Kamal Haasan and Fahaad Faasil fight against 
  the drug racket.in the last of movie,there comes <em>Rolex(SURIYAA).</em><br />
  "Leo," the latest addition to the Lokesh Cinematic Universe alongside the acclaimed "Kaithi" and "Vikram," is a sheer display
  of cinematic brilliance and adrenaline-pumping action. Seamlessly weaving its narrative, the film sets a new standard for 
  action-oriented storytelling, accentuated by a pulsating soundtrack that ignites every frame. The synergy of the entire 
  team behind "Leo" is commendable, with each element contributing to the film's distinctive identity within the LCU.,
  and Now we are eagerly waiting for the next part of LCU.....

<h3>5. INCEPTION(2010)</h3>
<img src="./inception.jpg" width="22%" />
<p>
  Now coming to hollywood,inception is a great science-fiction movie.the movie inception was directed by one of the best
  hollywood film-maker, CHRISTOPHER NOLAN(who is known for complex storytelling blockbusters),he has really done a
  magnificient job.The basis of this movie is dream stealing(lucid dreaming).<br />
  The acting of Leonardo Di Caprio,Cillian Murphy,Tom Hardy,Joseph-Gordon-Levitt was really amazing.the story is that
  Leonardo Di Caprio is lucid dreamer(who can sense in a dream that he is dreaming and can further dream).he can go to
  3 levels of dream success-fully,he was creating his own world in dream with his wife.generally, to come out of a dream,he
  used to die in dream,as our brain doesn't know what happens after death! his wife gets in delusion that she is stuck in a 
  dream but she was in actual world,so she decided to commit suicide.....

<h3>6.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION</h3>
<img src="./shawshank.jpg" width="30%" />
<p>Another Hollywood cult classic! this movie is the highest rated movie on IMDB And there is no doubt  has a very 
  beautiful story.This is movie is based on theme of 1930's-40's.Also the casting of this movie was amazing.this 
  movie is being starred by Morgan Freeman,Tim Robbins,Bob Gunton etc.<br />
  In movie,there is a banker who is falsely accused of murdering her own wife and now he have been sentenced life 
  imprisonment from.In the Jail where Everyone was innocent(Tim Robbins was truly innocent),Tim Robbins and Morgan
  Freeman became very good friends.Now,after 19 years Morgan Freeman is set free from Jail but not Tim Robbins.So,
  he escapes very smartly.....The story progresses very beautifully or the depiction of the story in movie is very 
  nicely done.......

<h3>7. MATRIX(1999-2021)</h3>
<img src="./Matrix.jpg" width="15%" />
<p>
  THE MATRIX is an unequaled masterpiece in cinematic filmmaking.Simply put, I've never seen anything like The Matrix,
  a powerful film that helps you rethink the power of your mind without rewiring the way you look at the human world. 
  Action is prevalent everywhere, even in the mysterious, stoic beginning.<br />
  Basically,it is a Sci-fi(science-fiction) film series in which the whole humanity is endangered by the rise Computers 
  and ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,they have took over the world and very few humans are left,the AI is continously fighting 
  with humans.....I personally think the concept of the movie was ahead of its time.Every actor in this series has done 
  perfect justice with their charecter.<br />
  This Movie stars Keanu Reaves,Laurence Fishburne,Carrie-Anne Moss.From myside, 10/10 to this movie!......
</p>
<hr />
<h3>8. YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI(2013)</h3>
<img src="./yeh_jawaani_hai_deewani.jpg" width="32%" />
<p>This is one of my favorite movies . I can't extoll how good this movie is... The movie is completely a roller-coaster 
  of emotions.This movie beautifully explains about Life , Love , one-sided love , family issue , friendships , life , economy 
  etc...this movie is completely worth watching, especially for the one who is sad or depressed should definitely 
  watch this movie . As everyone in this movie have just nailed it.Ranbir Kapoor ,Deepika Padukone,Aditya roy Kapoor have done a great job.<br />
  The first half is from Naina's (Deepika Padukone) point of view and her falling in love in a natural possible way. Its so beautiful 
  how love can feel like and that sometimes letting it go - is natural, and that it is good to fall in love, if we will find ourselves 
  and feel happy genuinely with that person. it is expressed perfectly.The second half is from Bunny's (Ranbir Kapoor) point of view and 
  how he is following his own self made footsteps, but with something missing.The hardships, family ka love, dreams, father love, letting 
  it go can make a huge change - good and bad, friendships, love is felt in the second half.So,in my opinion it is perfect treat to watch.

<h3>9. SITA RAMAM(2022)</h3>
<br />
<img src="./sita ramam.jpeg" height="60%"/>
<p>You guys maybe surprised to see this movie in this list but personally speaking it is one of the best love stories.But yes,I am fond of love stories.the
   movie is based on theme of 1940s-50s.<br />
Literally speaking,Dulquer Salman and Mrunal Thakur just owned their charecter,Rashmika Mandanna was also amazing.Their acting was a treat to viewer's eyes.
 Music was also very good.<br />Basically the story is about an orphan Soldier,who gets many letters from all over india Because he has stopped a terrorist
  attack and riots with his intellience.Everyone in their letter addressed themselves as his brother,sister,mother etc.But in one letter the sender's name was <em>Sita his lover</em>....
And the story propagates very beautifully from here.</p>

<h3>10. 3-IDIOTS(2009)</h3>
<img src="./3-Idiots.jpg" width="35%" />
<p>
  Now coming to the end of this list we have 3-IDIOTS.It is kind of motivational movie for me,It motivated me to pursue engineering 
  Three Idiotsâ€™ is a remarkable ahead of its time Bollywood blockbuster. This film is a comedy movie with strong acting, memorable 
  characters, a perplexing storyline and most importantly, highly motivational movie to choose the right path in your life.<br />
  The producers of the movie expressed some amazing scenery of the mountainous landscape of Ladakh. These scenes were taken with 
  various different camera angles such as high angle, crane and parallax shots. These colourful scenes were ingeniously used to 
  infer that a happy and exiting moment was to come.The Movie starred Aamir khan as <em>Phonsukh Wandu aka Rancho</em> and R Maadhavan 
  as <em>Farhaan Qureshi</em> and Sharman Joshi as <em>Raju Rastogi</em> and Boman Irani as <em>Veeru Sahastra Buddhy aka VIRUS</em>
  Also the story telling was also very remarkable.And as finishing touches to make this movie perfect the Makers added the melodious
  songs.<br />
  It is 10/10 movie according to me.
